        <h2><em>COVID-19</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally.
                The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO)
                <br>Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also
                lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.

           <p>
               The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has revealed that nearly <b>1300</b> doctors have lost their lives since the pandemic hit in the early months of 2020.
               to this pandemic during the second wave while serving others.
               Nearly 594 doctors have lost their lives to this pandemic during the second wave while serving others.

            After the first wave, the healthcare system moved on to tackle other medical emergencies that were neglected during 
            the first wave, and dedicated COVID-19 facilities were converted back to their previous functions.
            In March, a few weeks before the new surge, Indian health minister and physician Harsh Vardhan asserted that India was in the “endgame” of the COVID-19 pandemic,
            justifying his government’s decision to export medical resources to other countries. 
            India had increased its oxygen exports to other countries by a whopping 734 percent in January 2021.
            It also exported around 193 million doses of vaccines. 
            But the picture changed drastically when India began recording a dramatic increase in new cases from April 15 onward, with more than 200,000 cases daily;
            now hospitals are running out of oxygen. 
            On April 23, the Indian media reported that
             25 critically ill COVID patients died due to oxygen shortages in a government hospital in Delhi.  
            “The surge took us by surprise and the system is now totally overwhelmed,” says Mishra.
